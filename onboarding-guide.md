# Onboarding Guide: Civic Hacking and You!
Hello! Welcome to Open Wichita. We are the local [Code for America](https://codeforamerica.org) brigade for Wichita, KS. Our mission is to foster a community of civic involvement through technology and education. We want to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems.

## We're civic hackers!
Civic hacking is the idea that small solutions can cause real impact. It's about understanding an issue, creating something to help the problem, see the impact it creates, and adapting based on the information.

Government can move slowly, sometimes VERY slowly. The other issue is government (especially local gov) is strapped for resources. They have a massive job and they can't always do it all themselves. There is a huge opportunity for any person in the area to contribute some time and energy to making things better.

We aim to be the antithesis of how government traditionally operates.

We do this by:
* Focusing on small scope projects targeting something specific.
* Rapidly prototyping and deploying projects, then iterating.
* Prioritizing the use and production of Open Source Software in all we do.
* Inviting anyone and everyone to express an idea for local impact.
* Inviting anyone and everyone to pitch in however they can.
* Our primary function is our project work. Everything we create as a community is open source and hosted on GitHub.

## Projects
Our projects are how we engage with the community. Making someone's life a bit better is the goal of every project.

### Want to find something to work on?
